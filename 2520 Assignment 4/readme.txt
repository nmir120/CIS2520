Option 1 (Initialize): Initializes tree by reading A4_data_f18.txt into an AVL tree.
Option 2 (Find a key): Asks user for key name, searches tree for it and displays frequency if found. If it is not in the tree, it displays "no_such_key".
Option 3 (Insert a key): Asks user for a key, adds it to the tree. If it is already in the tree, the frequency of the key is incremented.
Option 4 (Remove a key): Asks user for a key, if it is found, it will be removed. If the frequency is only 1, the node is removed entirely.
Option 5 (Check height and size): Calculates and displays height, size, and total frequency count.
Option 6 (Find all): Asks user for frequency number, finds all keys with frequency greater than or equal to user input. 
Option 7 quits the program.
