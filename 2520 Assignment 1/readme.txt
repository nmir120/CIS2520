Question 1: Carbon
Program should run and print out 720 lines with different combinations
of the letters 'c', 'a', 'r', 'b', 'o', and 'n'
ex:
carbon
carbno
cabron

Question 2: Ackermann's function
Program takes two input values and gives an answer using Ackermann's function
ex:
Input values of (0, 1) should output: "The answer is: 2",
Input values of (4, 0) should output: "The answer is: 13",
Input values of (2, 2) should output: "The answer is: 7"
The maximum input values are (4, 0), as (4, 1) and (5, 0) exceed the value of the maximum integer in the C system on SoCS machines

Question 3: Newton's function
Program takes a value, x, finds the square root with an accuracy input, through recursion and non-recursion (while loop)
ex: An input of 10 and 0.0001 should output:
"Using recursion: the square root of 10.000000 with an accuracy of
1.000000e-04 is 3.162278e+00

Using a while loop: the square root of 10.000000 with an accuracy of
1.000000e-04 is 3.162278e+00"
